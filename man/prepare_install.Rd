\details{
\code{prepare_install} is soft-deprecated, use \code{prepare_install2}
instead.

Installing packages in R session could require restarts if
a package to be updated has been loaded. Normally restarting R
fixes the problem. However, under some circumstances, such as with a
startup code in profile, restarting R might still fail the
installation. \code{prepare_install2} starts a new session with clean
environments for installation.
